# Changelog

## 12/06/2026 @ 08:09:11 IST — "claude-fable-5"

**Goal:** Close every remaining gap from the Phase 1 build — full plan parity plus the requested upgrades: theme toggle, mobile view, local email box, Obsidian-style notes graph, settings parity, styled feedback.

**Added:**
- **Theme toggle (dark/light)** — next-themes with class strategy, persisted in localStorage; light token overrides for every CSS variable, glass surface, scrollbar, and translucent hover state; Sun/Moon toggle in the topbar. Cause of prior miss: shipped dark-only in Phase 1. Verification: typecheck clean, toggle renders after hydration guard.
- **Mobile view** — hamburger in the topbar plus a slide-in drawer with the full nav, and a 5-slot bottom tab bar on <768px; new `.page-h` utility accounts for the bottom bar height so panes don't overflow; IDE tree narrows on small screens.
- **Email box** — new `emails` table (inbox/sent/drafts/trash, read/star flags) with seeded welcome message; CRUD API (`/api/emails`, `/api/emails/[id]`); three-pane mail UI (folder rail, message list, reading pane) with compose dialog, star, trash/restore, delete-forever; signature + from-address settings appended on send. Local-only by design — SMTP noted as planned.
- **Settings parity** — Integrations (six bridge cards), Shortcuts (keybinding reference), Account (local profile in settings KV), Agent Tools (memory read/write toggles aliasing autoExtract/autoInject; future tools marked Soon), Email (from + signature). Settings nav now has all nine sections from plan F6.
- **Styled feedback** — zustand toast + promise-based confirm stores with `Toaster`/`ConfirmHost` mounted in the shell; every native `confirm()`/`alert()`/`prompt()` replaced (memory delete, tidy/decay results, session delete ×2, note delete, IDE file create/delete, provider remove, system wipe — wipe now requires typing WIPE in a styled dialog).
- **Provider Test button** — `/api/providers/[id]/test` runs a 15s-bounded one-token generate; result surfaces as a success/error toast.
- **Plan-parity memory routes** — `/dashboard/memory-bank/new` (full-page form with pin option) and `/dashboard/memory-bank/[id]` (deep-linkable detail); memory bank honors `?focus=`/`?new=1`, sessions honors `?new=1` (command palette deep links now all work).
- **Obsidian-style notes graph** — `/api/notes/graph` + D3 force graph (violet nodes, favorites amber, sized by content length); toggle in the notes sidebar; clicking a node opens that note.
- **Chat Agent|Chat toggle** — segmented mode pill in the chat input bar per plan F2.

**Fixed:**
- Dev server log clean during smoke test; all 8 new/changed pages return HTTP 200; email CRUD round-trips verified with curl. Cause-level fix carried from smoke testing: none new (FTS prefix fix shipped in prior entry).

**Files Touched:** 20 new files (email module, settings pages, feedback system, notes graph, memory routes, theme toggle, mobile nav) and ~18 modified (shell, sidebar/topbar, globals.css, schema/client, chat input, all confirm/alert call sites).

## 12/06/2026 @ 07:42:01 IST — "claude-fable-5"

**Goal:** One-shot greenfield build of Matrix Dash from `matrix-dash-plan.md` — a local-first AI command center with autonomous memory, multi-provider chat, sessions, notes, IDE, and settings.

**Added:**
- **Scaffold** — Next.js 15 (App Router, TS strict), Tailwind v4, pnpm. `serverExternalPackages: ["better-sqlite3"]` so the native driver works in route handlers. `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlists better-sqlite3's build script (pnpm 10 blocks them by default). Verification: `pnpm typecheck` zero errors; dev server ready in ~1.8s.
- **DB layer** (`lib/db/`) — Drizzle schema for all 9 tables (memories, memory_links, notes, note_links, sessions, session_messages, ai_providers, files, settings); SQLite singleton at `~/MatrixDash/matrix.db` (WAL, FK on) that bootstraps tables, FTS5 virtual tables, and sync triggers on first connect; FTS helpers with sanitized prefix queries (`"term"*` so "glass" matches "glassmorphism"). Verification: curl CRUD round-trips on every endpoint.
- **Autonomous memory** (`lib/ai/`) — extraction service (runs after each chat reply via `onFinish`, parses model JSON tolerantly, never throws into the chat path), injection engine (pinned-first + FTS relevance, type-balanced, usage-count tracking), FTS-based auto-linking, tidy/decay consolidation engine.
- **AI registry** — Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / custom (OpenAI-compatible baseURL) via Vercel AI SDK v5; API keys encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (key in `~/MatrixDash/.key`, mode 0600). Cause of one fix: `@ai-sdk/google` exports `createGoogleGenerativeAI`, not `createGoogle` as the plan assumed.
- **API routes** — chat streaming (`/api/ai/chat`), memories CRUD + graph + stats + tidy, memory-links, notes CRUD with `[[wiki-link]]` sync, note backlinks, global search, sessions + messages, files CRUD, providers CRUD, settings KV, system export/wipe. Verification: smoke-tested all endpoints with curl; wipe requires `confirm: "WIPE"`.
- **UI** — glassmorphic OLED design system (Geist Sans/Mono, emerald accent, mesh-gradient backdrop, custom glass utilities); dashboard shell with collapsible sidebar, topbar, ⌘K command palette (cmdk + live FTS search); GSAP staggered page entrances respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`; chat with token streaming + abort + markdown/code-copy; memory bank with list/detail/D3 force graph (drag, zoom, type-colored nodes); notes with editor/preview, wiki-links, backlinks panel; sessions timeline with resume-in-chat; Monaco IDE (file tree, tabs, dirty markers, ⌘S + autosave, custom matrix-dash theme); settings (providers, memory toggles, appearance tokens, system export/danger zone). Verification: all 9 dashboard pages return HTTP 200 in dev.

**Files Touched:** ~70 new files across `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `types/`, plus `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `.gitignore`.
